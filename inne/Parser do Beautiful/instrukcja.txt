Installing BeautifulSoup for Python in Windows
It's very easy.

Download BeautifulSoup and extract it, say to C:\TEMP\BeautifulSoup-3.1.0.1
Go to that folder and run command setup.py install (assuming *.py is known in path extensions, otherwise run c:\python25\python setup.py install).

That's it. Obviously it is an usual procedure to follow for many Python libraries.

To check it works create file testbs.py containing:
import urllib2
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup

page = urllib2.urlopen("http://www.google.com")
soup = BeautifulSoup(page)
print soup.prettify()

BeautifulSoup is a library for HTML and XML parsing. It promises it can parse not well formed HTML, right. I was bought by that promise to try this library after discovering that htmllib.HTMLParser works with perfect HTML only. But I found one site (actually biggest Chinese web search site) that crashed BeautifulSoup. Changing URL to page = urllib2.urlopen("http://www.baidu.com") raised an exception:

File "D:\Python25\lib\HTMLParser.py", line 115, in error
raise HTMLParseError(message, self.getpos())
HTMLParser.HTMLParseError: junk characters in start tag: u'\u767e\u5ea6\u4e00\u4e0b id=sb>', at line 3, column 233
